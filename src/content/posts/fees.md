“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” – Benjamin Franklin. 


Despite only being 15 years old, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER) have a lot to boast of today. Most of them rank very high on domestic indices like the NIRF ranking, faring better than many Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) – the representative ‘elite’ institutes in India. Over the years, IISERs have been able to produce excellent research output as well as provide a fantastic environment conducive for prowess in both academics and research. 

However, one key norm that has routinely set the IISERs apart from the IITs and other private colleges is that it has been (and still is) much cheaper to study at an IISER. IISERs’ student-friendly fee structure has enabled students from all communities and all financial backgrounds to get admitted and pursue their education for a (largely) research-oriented career. In accommodating students from almost all financial backgrounds, IISERs have shown a commitment towards making a truly ‘merit-based’ admission system, where individuals have been admitted and fostered solely based on their merit and not based on their ability to afford the education. 

Unfortunately though, over the years, the fees at IISERs have gone up (even though still much lesser than most other places of similar quality) and this might have consequences. The tuition fee constitutes the major chunk of our total fees. Over the years, the tuition fees at IISER Pune have increased considerably.

A point of relief is that the tuition fee hike that started in 2014 ended in 2019 (after a net increase of 304.8%). Since then, every subsequent batch (2020 and 2021) has had the same tuition fees. However, the total fee per student has continued increasing. For instance, the fee breakup for the Spring 2022 semester specifies that the students of semesters 8 and 10 are supposed to pay Rs. 1250 for Electricity and Water Charges and Rs. 100 for sports and recreation. Their immediate juniors in semester 6 are expected to pay Rs. 2500 for Electricity and Water Charges and Rs. 1000 for sports and recreation, which is strikingly double and ten times the fees paid by their seniors, respectively. The change in policy that implements the hike not on the tuition fee but rather on other fees might be more disadvantageous for students from some marginalized groups. Students from SC/ST backgrounds do not have to pay any tuition fees. Therefore, a fee hike on tuition fees alone would only hike the fees for a fraction of all students. But hiking the fees for other amenities increases the fee by equal magnitudes across categories. Therefore, while in the August 2019 semester, BS-MS students from SC/ST backgrounds had to pay only Rs.5500 uniformly across batches (semesters 3,5,7,9), in the January 2022 semester, students from SC/ST backgrounds have to pay Rs.9,271 if they’re in semester 8 and Rs.11,821 if they’re in semester 6. 

The debate surrounding the increase of fees in public universities is not limited to IISERs alone. There have been numerous arguments on both sides of the policy, including legal battles in the case of some central universities. In addition, the case against increasing fees in public universities is somewhat universal. While I claim no authority on the subject and acknowledge wholly the experience and aptitude of policymakers, this is an attempt to put forth an undergraduate student’s perspective. 

A moral take on the issue would be that the government has a moral obligation to educate the youth of the country, that the government invests in educational institutes, not because it is driven by an interest to generate revenue but to educate its students. This moral responsibility is extended towards every aspiring student in the country. High fees without financial support put an implicit cut-off, making it difficult for students who are not extremely privileged to study in the institute. 

A bigger logical inconsistency, in my opinion, is the issue of a partial subsidy. IISERs and other central universities have state-of-the-art facilities. The labs, hostels, campus, and other amenities at IISER are a lot more valuable than the thousands of rupees. In order for the institute to truly offset its costs with students’ fees, students would have to be charged far more, which they are not. This means that the students who get admitted to IISER still enjoy enormous subsidies despite the recent hike in fees. But the hike just introduces a barrier as to who gets to avail these facilities at a subsidized rate. A partial subsidy implies that a student can avail all the subsidies provided by the institute only if they are first a certain amount of rich. Students who cannot afford to pay over a lakh in fees cannot avail the “world-class” facilities of IISERs (in the absence of financial support) regardless of how meritorious they may be. Therefore, any subsidy must be full. 

In the specific case of IISERs and other research institutes, the problem of high fees has another layer to it. Unlike the engineers of IITs and the MBA grads of IIMs (Indian Institutes of Management), students graduating from IISER often take up a career in research – which does not usually pay nearly as much as the former two. Therefore families, especially working-class families and those with financial difficulties, will be even more reluctant to send their child to a research institute, in the event of a fee hike. Even loans will be difficult to pay off, as undergraduate science education is often followed up by a PhD and postdoctoral research, only after which do individuals usually get permanent positions. It is also important to note that forcing research graduates into further financial stress may lead to brain drain in the country, as institutes in the Global North typically pay meatier stipends for doctoral students. 

One of the proposed solutions to the issue is to have need-based financial support systems, where students from financially worse-off backgrounds get additional support from the institute, while better-off students pay the less subsidized fees. However, it would perhaps be easier to make these changes in the fee structure itself rather than have a separate administratively difficult process of claiming refunds or assistance. 

By making changes in the structure, I’m explicitly referring to cutting down the tuition fees of students from the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Other Backward Classes-Non-Creamy Layer (OBC-NCL). When the institutes (rightly) give reservations to students from EWS and OBC-NCL, they officially recognise that these students are disadvantaged on the basis of financial privilege. Despite this, these students are forced to pay the same tuition fees as general category (GEN) students. It would be vastly beneficial if students from EWS and OBC-NCL backgrounds too were exempted from paying tuition fees, like students from Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) backgrounds, for whom this exemption is already in practice. 

A problem with making household income the sole determinant of who needs financial assistance is it ignores other forms of marginalization that are not caste or class-based. For instance, women are categorically discriminated against by family and societal attitudes towards their education and it is well documented that families are less willing to spend on their daughters’ education than their sons. It is no secret that IISERs have fewer women enrolled than men. In India, young girls are often wedded off midway through their college by their families, and making such students dependent on their parents during their college years is rather challenging for many women to pursue their careers in whatever path they choose. Amidst all of this is the reluctance of the average Indian parent to let their children study pure sciences at an undergraduate level. By having nominal or no fees, the institutes can give aspiring students the agency to continue pursuing their education without depending on their families, regardless of the financial circumstances of their families. 

I joined IISER in 2018, after a private school education in a big urban metropolis. Having studied all my school life in a homogenous, mostly upper class, upper caste student population from affluent, privileged backgrounds, IISER Pune’s extraordinary diversity was an entirely different experience. Over the past four years, more than any kind of academics and research, I’ve grown to love and cherish this diverse, heterogenous student community of IISER where you can find someone from everywhere in the country, from vastly different financial backgrounds, from every regional and cultural identity; and I cannot subvert the paranoia of this wholesome, inclusive, multicultural environment changing.
