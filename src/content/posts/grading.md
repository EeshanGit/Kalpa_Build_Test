We’ve all had an awkward “Sharma Ji ka beta/beti” moment in our lives. This mythical personality generally lives close by (very often, right next door); is respectful to everyone; is good at everything they do, be it sports, dance, music, literature; and, above all, has a spotless report card. In other words, they are the epitome of the word “impeccable”. As such heights of perfection are generally unattainable, the last point (that of marvellous grades) is generally used as the indicator of real world “Sharma Ji ka betas/betis”, with the other qualities often assumed to follow as part of the natural progression of things.


As students of an elite research institute, most of the students at IISER Pune have been toppers from their respective schools. So when IISER Pune decided to introduce a new grading scheme with effect from the batch of 2018-2023, many began to wonder how it would impact the grades distributions. But first, it would be good to take a detour and describe how both the grading schemes function.


Till the 2017-2022 batch, IISER followed a grading scheme with a 2-point interval. The possible passing grades and points allotted to each were: O=10 pts, A = 10 pts, B = 8 pts, C = 6 pts, D = 4 pts. The letter grades were allotted according to a relative grading scheme, based on the class median and standard deviation. After much requests by the students, the administration decided that the 2-point difference was too harsh, especially for people who missed out on getting a higher grade by a mark or two.


The new grading scheme starting from 2018 had the following passing grades: A+ = 10 pts, A = 9 pts, B+ = 8 pts, B = 7 pts, C+ = 6 pts, C = 5 pts, D = 4 pts. The borderline marks for getting an A+ was to be completely instructor-dependent, and the remaining range of passing scores was to be evenly divided into six equal intervals. On paper, it looked like the solution to all grading-related woes.


However, not everything turned out the way it was expected. Instructors were reluctant to hand out A+ grades, with some courses awarding this grade to 3-4 students, and other courses choosing not to award the grade at all.

 An informal survey conducted earlier this year found that the average GPA obtained by a student was 8.4 for the 2017 batch (based on 40 respondents), 7.8 for the 2018 batch (based on 124 respondents) and 7.6 for the 2019 batch (based on 99 respondents). Further, the number of students with CGPA 9 and above was found to be 27 out of 168 students for the 2015 batch, 21 out of 84 students for the 2016 batch, 17 out of 40 students for the 2017 batch, 15 out of 124 students for the 2018 batch and 2 out of 99 students for the 2019 batch.


Following the results of the survey, a petition asking for a revision of the new grading scheme was submitted to the administration, and received around 280 signatures from the students of the 2018-2020 batches. The administration’s response to the petition is still awaited.


“In our system, very often, professors award an A+ grade to very, very few students, sometimes to none at all, treating it similar to the O grade in the old system”, a respondent to the survey points out. “However, an A grade is worth only 9 points for us, whereas in the old system it was worth 10. Since most of the time very few students are given an A+, most students are given grade points only from 9 and below, as compared to the old system where even outside the students who got an O, the remaining students are still given grade points from 10 and below. As a consequence, our grades are being ‘pushed down’ in some sense relative to students of previous batches.”

But what makes these issues in the new grading scheme so significant? For starters, the COVID pandemic struck in 2020, meaning students from the 2018 batch onwards missed out on crucial semester, summer, and winter internships. This was especially pronounced in the case of students from experiment-heavy research areas, with many not having done a single research project so far, and others shifting to computation-driven areas in an attempt to pick up some research experience before starting their MS theses. In such a situation, higher CGPAs would have helped boost their resumes. Further, several students do not have home environments congenial for the kind of uninterrupted studying that is possible on campus, hence hindering their academic performance during the last three semesters conducted online due to the pandemic.

Then there is the issue of being eligible for PhD programmes and scholarships. Most elite research institutes in India (including IISER-Pune itself)  require PhD applicants to have a CGPA of 8 or above to be considered for admission into their programmes. Several US universities often impose a GPA requirement of either 8 or 8.5 out of 10 to even be eligible to apply. The same also holds for fellowships like the DAAD-WISE, KVPY and INSPIRE fellowships, which have eligibility criteria of CGPA 8.5, 6.5 and 7 respectively. When compared to the data about the average CGPAs obtained from the survey, this means that an average student from the 2018 and 2019 batch is not eligible to apply to several PhD programmes and fellowships. Adding fuel to the fire, many places mention a lowered cutoff specifically for the IITs due to their greater academic reputation, despite their grading scheme being no more stringent than ours.

The students of the 2018 batch are particularly disadvantaged compared to students from later years – in the fall 2020 semester, they had several courses which also had participation from students of the 2017 batch. In these courses, the grading was carried out in accordance with the new grading scheme, and for students of the 2017 batch, the “plus” grades and “non-plus” grades were clubbed together, in accordance with their scheme.

This meant that for a similar academic performance in such a course, a student from the 2018 batch could receive a lower point, and hence potentially a lower CGPA. This was especially problematic as due to the pandemic, several students from the 2017 batch would have to delay their PhD applications, and could be applying alongside the students from the 2018 batch, with higher GPAs and greater research experience due to the one extra covid-free year they got for their specialization. Further, the apparent drop in grades of courses with seniors could look like the student had lost interest in their coursework, without giving a true picture of what was going on behind the scenes.


Lastly, the interdisciplinary course structure at IISER requires students to take introductory courses in all areas of science during the first 3-4 semesters of coursework, before taking a call on which area to major in (if at all). This is a beautiful system and has enabled students to discover which area of science truly fascinates them, in order to be able to subsequently make informed choices about their future studies. However, a downside to this is that not all students perform well in all areas of science, and if they are unable to compensate for this in their later semesters after choosing a major, they get demoralized and end up fretting more about how to improve their grades than about understanding course contents (the two need not necessarily be synonymous, as we all know) or acquiring knowledge that may serve them well in their future academic life.  This even leads to many students choosing to take ‘easy’ courses that may be irrelevant to their career simply as a desperate improvement to save their GPAs. 

Thus, overall, the new system has ended up being more detrimental than the old system it was intended to replace. Despite being a very young institute, the education and scientific exposure imparted at IISER is superior to most other institutes in India, as is clear from the institute’s NIRF rankings. Even during the trying times of the covid pandemic, the administration has been very cooperative and has done its best to ensure the welfare of students. Hence it would be incredibly sad if low grades and an ill-timed pandemic were to be the one thing holding us back from a future in the fundamental sciences.

NOTE: While it is a possibility that students of the 2017 batch have better GPAs because of having taken more electives, the fact still remains that they had students who have received 10 SGPAs in semesters and even had 10 CGPA at some point.

Further, it could be true that these averages are subject to sampling biases as the number of people who filled the survey forms does not constitute the full batch strengths.

However, it still remains to be the case where there have been a number of courses, where the number of A+s awarded barely exceed a handful, and a few other which none have been awarded at all.
