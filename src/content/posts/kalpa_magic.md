There is something magical about seeing art; to see expression, possibility, emotion, imagination.
There’s something magical about making art; the process of creation, the inspiration and thought
that is irreducibly opaque, exciting, and fundamentally a part of being human. There is something
magical about sharing (and facilitating) art. Take some thoughts, assemble to a form, and send
that form out to play with the world. The joy of touching and exchanging with different minds, the
tension of always imperfect translations (between languages, people, lives).
Why, in a scientific institution, must I talk of magic?
To me, it is magical to see beauty and vitality in everything around me. I haven’t always grasped
the sheer importance of that inexplicable magic in my life, my society, and my profession. In our
formal writing, we tend to act as if it doesn’t exist. We don’t always acknowledge the fundamental
role of imagination in shaping our possible futures. Working for Kalpa in 2009 and 2010, labouring
with a team of dear friends, was all of these things for me – a chance to be involved in so much
magic! Kalpa carried the first piece of poetry I ever wrote (written in a burst like I am writing
now). It* showed me that there are many ways of being an artist (and therefore, a person) that
my younger (grammar obsessed, English educated, and puritan) self hadn’t known. It made me
appreciate the labour that goes into publishing.
‘Does it matter that I pay so much attention to where the commas go?’
‘Should we really be letting XYZ be so long winded?’
‘The deadline is far away, we’ll certainly be done by then.’
‘Who’s going to take on writing all these reports on the glory of IISER?’
‘It would sound so much better if they just framed it this way!’ ‘No, that would be you writing in
your particular way, this magazine is not about you.’
‘Just one more round of edits.’
‘Why can’t this printer understand our colour scheme?’
‘Please, please give your article by the deadline…’
A huge, huge debt of gratitude to Sisir C. Anand (from the 2006 batch) and Prof. G. Ambika. We
complained a lot, feared their e-mails, and kept pushing their deadlines. Their initiative and
dedication really gave Kalpa a start in the world, a start from which it has continued to grow!
And a huge debt of gratitude to all the artists of IISER who have shared bits of themselves with the
world, through Kalpa!
Here’s to many more decades of expression and imagination!

*Here, I am frustrated by the way gender and animacy are tied to pronouns in English. ‘It’ suggests
inanimacy, but Kalpa doesn’t feel inanimate to me, rather brimming with so many lives! To show
animacy, I must use ‘he’ or ‘she’, and I can’t give Kalpa a gender…
